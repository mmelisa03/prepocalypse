# Apocalypse Prep: A Vue 3 Survival Checklist 🧟‍♀️🤘

This is a **work-in-progress** Vue 3 web app themed around **zombies, spooky robots, and the end of the world**. Built as a creative way to explore Vue 3 fundamentals—components, props, events, reactivity, and scoped styling—while having a little fun.

## 💀 What It Does

This app allows you to:
- Select an apocalypse scenario (like zombies or killer robots)
- View a themed survival checklist with emojis 😱
- Return to the main scenario list to choose again
- Enjoy a creepy, stylized UI with custom fonts and backgrounds

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice Vue 3 fundamentals: components, props, computed properties, conditionals, lists, and events
- Apply scoped CSS for styling with themed fonts and background images
- Deploy project updates incrementally using GitHub

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) (Vite starter template)
- HTML5 + CSS3 (Scoped styles in SFCs)
- Google Fonts (`Creepster`)
- Emojis for extra flair 💥
- Background images for immersive design

## 🧪 Status

This project is a **learning sandbox** and will evolve as new Vue concepts are explored.

Planned additions:
- 🧟‍♂️ Animated elements (floating zombies?)
- 🕸️ Spooky overlay filters
- 🎸 Rock band references and audio clips
- 🧰 Dark/light toggle
- 🚧 404 Error Page
